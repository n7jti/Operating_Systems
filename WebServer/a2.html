In this assignment, you will implement two versions of a simple web
server, using C or C++ as your programming langauge.  In the first
version, you will use threads (via the pthreads interface) to handle
requests concurrently.  In the second version, you will use a single
thread and event-driven asynchronous I/O to handle requests
concurrently.  The goal of the assignment is to let you explore these
two different styles of concurrent programmiung, and to give you some
exposure to the nuts and bolts of network programming and the web.

Obviously, implementing a fully-featured web server that is capable of
handling all aspects of modern Web protocols would be completely
unrealistic for a two-week assignment.  Instead, we want you to focus
on a relatively small subset of features.  Your server should support
all of the following, for both the threaded and event-driven versions.
</p><p>

<b>Concurrent requests:</b> most importantly, your server should be
able to handle and process HTTP requests concurrently.  In other
words, it should be possible for multiple clients (or even a single
client) to open several HTTP requests to your server simultaneously,
and your server should make progress on reading the requests from the
network, generating responses, and writing the responses back to the
clients concurrently.  Said differently, the server should not
serialize requests: if one request progresses slowly (e.g., the client
is on a slow network connection), the other requests should not block
behind that slow request.

<b>Simple HTTP/1.1 support:</b> the HTTP specification is complex and
large.  You only need to handle a very simple subset of it.
Specifically, you need to be able to handle GET requests.  You do not
need to handle persistent connections, pipelined requests, chunked
transfers, or other advanced HTTP/1.1 features.  You will need to
write a simple parser to parse HTTP requests and extract the requested
URL from them, but that should be pretty easy to do.  You will also
need to figure out how to generate a well-formatted HTTP response.
So, to do these two things, you should read up on the HTTP protocol
enough to determine how to do this.  I'd recommend you experiment with
real browsers and real servers: figure out how to use a program like
netcat (nc on linux) to open a listening socket and direct a browser
to it, in order to see what real browser requests look like.  Also
figure out how to use telnet to connect to a real web server (e.g.,
www.cs.washington.edu) to figure out what a real server response looks
like.  Then, mimic that.
<p>

<b>Static, in-memory files:</b> instead of reading requested content
from files in the file-system, you should instead have a set of static
HTML pages hard-coded into your program.  When a client requests one
of them, you should return that static content.  If a client requests
some other page, you should return an HTTP error indicating the page
could not be found.  The specific page URLs and content you should
support are:

</p><ul>
  <li> <tt>/a2.html</tt> &#8212; this page;  use "view source" from a
  browser (or some other tool) to get at the HTML of this page, and
  include it in your server.  Be sure to return MIME-type
  <tt>text/html</tt> for this page.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> <tt>/book/dracula.html</tt> &#8212; the project gutenberg version
  of the book Dracula, which is <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-h/345-h.htm">available
  from here</a>.  Note this is a fairly large document, which means it
  is unlikely that you will be able to write the entire document in a
  single non-blocking write() system call.  The MIME-type for this
  page should also be <tt>text/html</tt>.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> <tt>/a2/mountain.jpg</tt> &#8212; the image of Mt. Shasta
  seen on the right.
  <p>

</p></li></ul>
<p>

<b>Command-line specifiable port:</b> typically a web server runs on
port 80, but there is nothing requiring this.  Your web server should
take a single command-line argument, which is the port number on which
your server listens.  Make sure this port is listening on the external
IP address of the machine, rather than the loop-back IP address.
(i.e., when we run your server, it should be possible to connect to
the server from a browser running different machine.)

For this assignment, you will implement the two servers largely from
scratch in either C or C++.  Here are some guidelines and requirements
about your code:

</p><ul>

  <li> Your code must compile and run on a standard Linux
  installation.  You should have an account on the CSE instructional
  linux cluster, including the machine attu1.cs.washington.edu.
  Before you turn in your code, please make sure you can compile it on
  attu1; we will be using that machine to compile and test your
  solution.  If you make use of any third-party code, you need to
  include that code in your turned-in assignment, in source or library
  form.  We will NOT be downloading and installing third-party code
  when testing your solution.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> Your code must exist within a single directory called "src/"
  within your turned-in solution.  Within that directory, there should
  be a Makefile.  We will run "make all" to compile your code and
  product two binaries -- one for the threaded server and one for the
  event-driven server.  Your threaded server binary should be called
  "551server_threaded" and your event-driven server binary should be
  called "551server_eventdriven".  Please don't submit binaries as
  part of your turn-in; we must be able to compile binaries from
  source using the command "make all".
  <p>

  </p></li><li> You should reuse code between your two servers wherever
  possible.  In particular, you should reuse code for request parsing
  and response synthesis.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> Your code should be clean, modular, readable, and
  well-commented.  We will run your code under valgrind to make sure
  there are no memory leaks or errors.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> Feel free to use third-party code to simplify the job of
  creating and managing sockets.  But, you should not use third-party
  code to handle the details of creating threads, setting up
  asynchronous events and I/O, or parsing/generating HTTP; you must do
  this part yourself.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> As a small hint, you should make sure you set up a default
  signal handler for the SIGPIPE signal that does nothing.  By
  default, Linux will send your process the SIGPIPE signal whenever a
  client drops its end of a TCP connection.  If you don't have a
  signal handler defined for it, your process will crash out.
  <p>
  
</p></li></ul>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tbody><tr bgcolor="#afff00">
    <td class="part" width="100%">
      <font face="Arial" size="3">
      <a name="threaded">Threaded Server</a>
      </font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>

For the threaded server, you should implement your code to have a main
thread that first creates the listening socket for your server, and
then permanently enters a loop, where it:

</p><ul>
  <li> blocks on the accept system call waiting for a new connection
  to arrive.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> creates and dispatches a new thread (using the pthreads
  interface) to handle that connection.  You should be sure to detach
  the thread so that your main thread doesn't have to worry about
  joining with the helper.
  <p>
</p></li></ul>

Each dispatched thread should read in a request from the new network
connection, generate a response, write the response, and then close
the network connection to the client.  The thread should also handle
the case where the request is poorly formatted, or the connection
to the client drops unexpectedly.  Be sure not to leak memory or file
descriptors.
<p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tbody><tr bgcolor="#afff00">
    <td class="part" width="100%">
      <font face="Arial" size="3">
      <a name="eventdriven">Event driven server</a>
      </font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>

Your event-driven server should have a single thread that processes
events in an event loop.  The kinds of events this thread must detect
and handle include:

</p><ul>
  <li> a new connection arrives; when this happens, you need to create
  and store some state for the connection that you use to keep track
  of data that has been received so far, whether you have received a
  full request, the response you generate, and how much of the
  response you have written.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> there is data waiting to be read from one of the open requests;
  when this happens, you should read that data.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> once you've generated a response for a connection, you should
  detect events that tell you that the connection's socket is
  writeable (i.e., there is buffer space in the OS, and therefore your
  write system call will be able to hand the OS some data)
  <p>

  </p></li><li> a connection has closed, either expectedly or unexpectedly
  <p>

</p></li></ul>

You will need to learn how to set a socket to be non-blocking, so that
your accept, read, write, and close system calls don't block your
single thread.  As well, you should learn about the poll system call,
and use that to register interest in events and receive those events.
<p>

Writing an event-driven server can be confusing.  You essentially need
to invert the control flow that you're used to with a threaded server.
Instead of having a thread sequentially read, generate, and write to
handle a connection, your single thread needs to juggle all of the
connections simultaneously, processing data when possible on each as
events arrive.  You should probably think about creating a simple
state machine for each connection to keep track of it, and then
transition from state to state (READING, WRITING) when handling
events.

</p><p>

You should use the following <a href="https://catalyst.uw.edu/collectit/dropbox/gribble/20067">catalyst
dropbox</a> to submit your assignment.  You should submit to the
"assignment #2" box a single .tar.gz archive that contains the
following:

</p><ul>
  <li> a text file, README.txt, that contains your name, email
  address, and a brief description of architecture of your server and
  how that maps to your source files.  In particular, describe each of
  the major modules or interfaces you designed in your solution, and
  how they fit together to solve the assignment.  Also mention any
  third-party code you used
  <p>

  </p></li><li> a subdirectory called "src"
  <p>

  </p></li><li> inside this subdirectory, you should include a Makefile and
  your source code.  As well, inside this directory, include any
  third-party code you relied upon.
  <p>
</p></li></ul>

As previously mentioned, before you submit your code, please copy it
to attu1.cs.washington.edu and make sure that you're able to compile,
run, and successfully exercise both of your servers on that machine,
since we'll be doing our testing and grading on it.
